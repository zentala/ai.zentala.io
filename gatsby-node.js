/**
 * `createPages` is a core function in Gatsby's Node API that is used for dynamically creating pages in a Gatsby site.
 * This function leverages GraphQL to fetch data and uses it to programmatically create pages with specific layouts,
 * using provided templates. It's a key part of Gatsby's data-driven approach to building sites.
 *
 * In this specific implementation, the function is used to create a blog landing page (the main blog index) and
 * individual blog post pages. It queries data about markdown files (or other data sources) and creates pages for
 * them using predefined templates. The paths for these pages are typically derived from the data itself, such as
 * slugs generated from markdown file names.
 *
 * @param {Object} params - The parameters provided by Gatsby's Node API, including graphql and actions.
 * @param {Function} params.graphql - A function for running GraphQL queries to fetch data.
 * @param {Object} params.actions - An object containing actions for creating pages.
 * @param {Function} params.actions.createPage - An action used to create pages programmatically.

 *

/**

 * the path to the page that will be created for each markdown file.
 *
 * This is essential for dynamically creating pages from markdown files, as the 'slug' field is used to generate URLs.
 * The `createFilePath` function from `gatsby-source-filesystem` is used to generate the slug based on the markdown file's
 * name and location. This slug is then added to each MarkdownRemark node, making it available in GraphQL queries
 * and allowing pages to be created with URLs derived from the markdown file names.
 *
 * @param {Object} params - The parameters provided by Gatsby's Node API, including node, getNode, and actions.
 * @param {Object} params.node - Represents a single node in the Gatsby data layer.
 * @param {Function} params.getNode - A helper function to retrieve a node by its ID.
 * @param {Object} params.actions - An object containing actions for manipulating nodes and the GraphQL schema.
