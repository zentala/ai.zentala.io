            Functional prototype of a socially-aware humanoid robot tailored for events and retail applications,
            enhancing its situational awareness through bespoke IoT integrations.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            The robot stood 1.6 metres tall and operated on a dual-servo system, incorporating a two-axis articulated
            head, touchscreen interface, touch-sensitive sensors and a docking (charging) station.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            The culmination of this four-month project was the result of a dynamic partnership: myself, a temporary
            software contractor tasked with software development of the robot, and Ula, a dedicated Cheil employee
            serving as R&D Art Director. Ula played a pivotal role in shaping the concept and design of this innovative
            robotic solution.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            We collaborated directly on the physical construction of the robot, starting with hardware decisions,
            continuing with the fabrication of the robot's skeleton and enclosure using CNC milling and 3D printing
            techniques, and ending with the final machine assembly.
