# Backstage as a Tool for Improving Developer Experience: How to Generate Ideas for New Features?

Backstage is a powerful tool, but the number of ready-made solutions (plugins) for Backstage is limited because Backstage (dev portal) is designed to map organization-specific processes and data. The greatest value that can be generated with it lies in its customization - how well it maps real company structures and how effectively it enables developers to navigate across company infrastructure. Custom tools play a key role here, allowing for efficient debugging, problem-solving, and prevention thanks to the information gathered in Backstage. Backstage provides a backbone of data for various kinds of automation, from code development using LLMs to quality checks. Before we start implementing solutions, it is essential to identify key objects within the IT department and ensure they are mapped to Backstage, sometimes using custom solutions. The question of what new features to implement in Backstage doesn't have a simple answer, as it is not about blindly copying solutions but understanding what developer needs require fulfillment. The answer lies in the DevEx (Developer Experience) approach, which involves consciously designing developer experiences, similar to how UX focuses on designing user experiences.

## What is Needed to Design Features in Backstage?

To generate ideas for new features, we need to combine several fields of knowledge. This includes:

*   **Developer Experience (DevEx)** - DevEx is about designing solutions with developers in mind, requiring knowledge of usability principles (UX) and being in close contact with users - the developers.
    
*   **User Experience (UX)** - UX are fundamental principles that we extend to DevEx, ensuring that features are intuitive and genuinely helpful.
    
*   **Knowledge of Backstage at the Code Level** - Backstage is a framework, so we need to understand its limitations and capabilities, knowing the API, available methods, functions, and libraries to effectively build new solutions.
    
*   **DevOps and Product Management** - Designing features requires a product management approach. Each new feature should be considered in terms of user value, as well as ways of implementation and further evaluation.
    

In a graphic representation, I imagine these fields as overlapping circles, where the common area is **DevEx** - combining UX, practical knowledge of Backstage, management, and education.


## DevEx as a Key to Growth

DevEx is about understanding how to improve developer experiences. What does it involve?

*   The most important aspect is involving developers in the process of designing new features. Only by continuously obtaining their feedback and responding to their real needs can we avoid the risk of investing time in things they do not need.
    
*   To do this effectively, we need **constant communication and channels for gathering feedback**. DevEx, like UX, is not a one-time action but a process that requires continuous collaboration.
    
*   In practice, this means creating feedback loops - opportunities for providing opinions on the site, leaving comments, clicking up/down icons, rating with stars 1-X, or analyzing usability metrics similar to UX analytics of websites.


The Role of a DevEx Evangelist
------------------------------

I am convinced that a key element of successfully implementing DevEx in our organization is the role of a **DevEx Evangelist**. An evangelist is a person who:

*   Has in-depth knowledge of Developer Experience, UX, development of developer portals, as well as skills in education and facilitating desired group dynamics.
    
*   Is able to inspire and teach others, conduct training, workshops, and help in making informed decisions.
    
*   Spends a significant portion of their time on education - both their own and that of the rest of the team.
    

### Education as a Foundation

The most time-consuming part of the DevEx implementation strategy is **education**. This process includes:

1.  Explaining the value that the development of a developer portal can bring.
    
2.  Defining key performance indicators and teaching how to identify them.
    
3.  Demonstrating what and how to track (analytics) in the plugin to measure if the goals are being met.
    
4.  Conducting a series of workshops in which developers define their needs and design solutions.
    
5.  Education on designing features and then implementing them.
    

A well-trained team has the opportunity to effectively create solutions that will have a real impact on their daily work. However, having technical and design skills is not enough. It is also necessary to have knowledge of the uncodified software development processes, and for this, we usually need to collaborate with current developers to gain internal team knowledge. Along this path, we will encounter various obstacles, such as employee resistance, which can be overcome by giving developers greater control over the process, empowering them, and supporting them in this work.

## Summary

I offer my services in implementing DevEx within our organization. I am ready to take on the role of an evangelist who will support developers, lead workshops, design new functionalities, and help build a shared vision for the development of Backstage. Introducing DevEx requires a change in approach â€“ it is not enough to copy the solutions of others; we must design our own in response to the needs of our developers, and the key to this is education, communication, and empowerment.
