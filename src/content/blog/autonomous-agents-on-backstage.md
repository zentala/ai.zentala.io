Developer Portals as a Gateway to Empowering Autonomous LLM Agents in Organizations

In the evolving landscape of software development, the tools we use today are shaping the work of tomorrow. Developer portals are not just repositories of knowledge or simple interfaces for developers; they are gateways to enabling autonomous LLM (Large Language Model) agents to efficiently solve problems within organizations by providing them with the needed context. The structured knowledge that developer portals provide offers a unique opportunity to transform how we think about onboarding, problem-solving, and automation.

Developer portals, like Backstage, help to structure and codify developer knowledge—knowledge that until now has often been passed through word of mouth, in-person guidance, or piecemeal documentation. When I work with clients, I often recommend they implement their developer portal as if it were meant to support asynchronous onboarding from the very beginning. This goal—an asynchronous onboarding experience—is valuable to aim for and serves as a measurement criterion for evaluating the maturity of an implementation. Setting this goal provides several benefits in terms of preparing for the future of software development.

First, a significant portion of future development work will be carried out by autonomous agents. Secondly, developers who join a project will increasingly find themselves hopping between projects, as agents take on more routine tasks. The concept of a fixed development team transferring knowledge within the team might become less common. Thus, to prepare for the future, organizations need to find ways to enable asynchronous knowledge transfer. The developer portal is the tool we can use to achieve this.

I often ask my clients to imagine onboarding a new developer who joined the company yesterday. They receive access to Backstage, Jira, Confluence, and GitHub—basic access and a task to implement tests for an application they've never seen before. The question is: will they be able to onboard themselves, using only the developer portal, and complete their assigned task autonomously? If the answer is yes, then we have achieved an effective asynchronous onboarding process.

By setting asynchronous onboarding as a goal, organizations can ensure they have a developer portal that codifies all the essential knowledge needed to start working. This level of codification is not only beneficial for human developers but also paves the way for autonomous LLM agents to take action. Once we have a comprehensive and structured knowledge base in our developer portal, we can connect it to chatbots and other agents capable of responding to queries and executing tasks based on the knowledge stored in Backstage.

Such agents will be able to tackle tasks beyond coding—they can manage DevOps processes, configure environments, and even execute broader operational workflows. By linking the entire infrastructure and DevOps configurations with Backstage and providing configured Codespaces where LLM agents can write and test their code, organizations can create a new model of distributed, automated problem-solving that leverages both human and machine capabilities.

In conclusion, developer portals are much more than a means to organize documentation—they are the foundation for future-proofing our development processes. They enable us to imagine a world where both developers and autonomous agents seamlessly navigate complex ecosystems, share knowledge, and solve problems without the friction of traditional knowledge transfer barriers. This vision is what we should strive to achieve if we want our organizations to be ready for the next era of software development.
